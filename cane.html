          <h4 class='titlep'>How does belonging/ identity appear in <i>Cane</i>?</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            Published in 1923 during The Harlem Renaissance, Cane is a collection of short stories, 
            poems, and vignettes that explore African Americans’ relationship with the South. The 
            first portion of Cane is devoted to the depiction of the rural South as an environment 
            that supported the African American community spiritually, but not culturally. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The South is situated as a <u>place that possesses qualities of spirituality and 
              pastoral beauty, but also as an environment that propagates pain, violence, and 
              terror.</u> The first section captures these themes through dusky, twilight imagery; 
            poems such as “Reapers”, “November Cotton Flower”, and “Face”, express a complex 
            sense of identity and place. Dusk and darkness describe both the beauty and the fear
            that African Americans face in the South. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Toomer depicts both the North and the South as dichotomous environments, rather 
            than complete opposites; <u> the North isn’t all “good” and the South isn’t all “bad”; 
              rather they are complex in how they are both “good” and “bad”.</u> Toomer focuses more 
            on the relationship between African American individuals and the North in his second 
            section of the text. The North is seen as a place of promise and a chance to create a 
            better future, but in reality, this environment costs one’s sense of community and 
            spirituality. Through “Seventh Street”, “Rhobert”, and “Box Seat”, the North is 
            depicted as a cold, harsh, materialistic space. The rural South is a traditional, 
            spiritual community that is trapped in the past, yet the North is the future - the urban, 
            mechanical void of a city that has promise, but those promises remain unfulfilled. 
            At the end of this section, Toomer leaves the reader thinking about how urban and 
            rural spaces are similar in the sense <u>that they are not singular. This makes it more 
              difficult to create clear divisions between the two. </u>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In the last section, “Kabnis”, Toomer recalls imagery and emotions from the first 
            two sections to express frustrations with both the country and the city. The 
            protagonist, Ralph Kabnis, has internalized the spiritual sterility and the barriers 
            of the North as he strives to belong in the South where he feels his roots are. His 
            identity is fragmented and he struggles to articulate who he is. Kabnis attempts to look 
            to the future and ignore the past and this very lack of acceptance contributes to 
            his absence of belonging. His inability to reconcile with Father John, a figure 
            who represents the past, leaves him as spiritually and culturally empty as he was
            in the beginning. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Overall, <u>Toomer creates a text in which the boundaries of identity, culture, and 
              place are blurred.</u> During the Great Migration (when this novel was written), many 
            African Americans uprooted their families from the South and moved to the North to 
            cities in search of a better life. <u>Cane raises important questions about what it 
              means to be ‘from’ somewhere and how history plays an important role in creating 
              meaning for a place.</u>

          “O land and soil, red soil and sweet-gum tree/ So scant of grass, 
            so profligate of pines/ Now just before an epoch's sun declines/ 
            Thy son, in time, I have in time returned to thee/ Thy son, I have in time 
            returned to thee.”(32)

            These lines from “Song of the Son” highlight African Americans’ 
            relationship with the South. The narrator of this poem returns to his roots in the 
            South, only to find it different, and degraded, from the last time he was there. 
            Though there is the curse of slavery on the land, many Northern American Africans are 
            nostalgic for it. The strong rapport between black people and the land can bring about 
            emotional and spiritual strength.

        <div class="txt quote2">

            “wears a house, like a monstrous diver’s helmet, on his head” (83)

        <div class="txt analysis2">
          <p>
            In the second section, more focused on urban life in the North, Toomer uses “Rhobert” to 
            illustrate how cities are an inorganic framework that holds together but also separates 
            organic beings. Typically, a diving helmet provides protection in the ocean by providing air 
            to keep its user alive, but in Rhobert’s case, the ‘helmet’ generates tension - it separates 
            him from the community and weighs him down. While inorganic things, like the helmet or a house, 
            can sustain life, it is a heavy load to bear. In the urban setting, African Americans must navigate 
            the city space, bearing that weight, in order to insert their culture and create a spiritually rich 
            environment.

            “Enough to draw a denial from you. Cant hold them, can you? Master; slave. 
            Soil; and the overarching heavens. Dusk; dawn. They fight and bastardize you. 
            The sun tint of your cheeks, flame of the great season's multi-colored leaves, 
            tarnished, burned. Split, shredded: easily burned” (225)

            Kabnis longs for a connection to the South that he cannot attain because he refuses to 
            accept his slave heritage. Lewis, unlike Kabnis, can accept the contradictions - the 
            beauty and the pain. Toomer highlights how one’s ‘belonging’ and one’s sense of community 
            must grapple with both the good and the bad, to be holistic. Until he accepts this whole past, 
            it seems as though he will not be able to gain spirituality, strength, and redemption 
            from the land like the others who are native to the South are able to.
