            Published in 1923 during The Harlem Renaissance, Cane is a collection of short stories, 
            poems, and vignettes that explore African Americans’ relationship with the South. The 
            first portion of Cane is devoted to the depiction of the rural South as an environment 
            that supported the African American community spiritually, but not culturally. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Toomer situates the South as a place that possesses qualities of spirituality and 
            pastoral beauty, but also as an environment that propagates pain, violence, and 
            terror. The first section captures these themes through dusky, twilight imagery; 
            poems such as “Reapears”, “November Cotton Flower”, and “Face”, express a complex 
            sense of identity and place. Dusk and darkness describe both the beauty and the fear
            that African Americans face in the South. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            These themes are exacerbated through the female protagonists of the text. 
            Karintha, Becky, Fern, and Louisa in “Blood Burning Moon”, specifically highlight 
            how the oppression of women and the degradation of the environment are inherently 
            interrelated. Women are depicted as Mother Earth figures, as vital life forces to 
            the community, yet they are also object of abuse and violence. Toomer’s depiction of 
            the rural South in this section portrays the connection between soul, land, community, 
            and identity and its relationship to the blood, smoke, and shadows that linger as a 
            reminder of the violent and painful heritage of slavery.

            Toomer depicts both the North and the South as dichotomous environments, rather 
            than complete opposites; the North isn’t all “good” and the South isn’t all “bad”; 
            rather they are complex in how they are both “good” and “bad”. Toomer focuses more 
            on the relationship between African American individuals and the North in his second 
            section of the text. The North is seen as a place of promise and a chance to create a 
            better future, but in reality, this environment costs one’s sense of community and 
            spirituality. Through “Seventh Street”, “Rhobert”, and “Box Seat”, the North is 
            depicted as a cold, harsh, materialistic space. The rural South is a traditional, 
            spiritual community that is trapped in the past, yet the North is the future - the urban, 
            mechanical void of a city that has promise, but those promises remain unfulfilled. 
            At the end of this section, Toomer leaves the reader thinking about how urban and 
            rural spaces are similar in the sense that they are not singular. This makes it more 
            difficult to create clear divisions between the two.

            In the last section, “Kabnis”, Toomer recalls imagery and emotions from the first 
            two sections to express frustrations with both the country and the city. The 
            protagonist, Ralph Kabnis, has internalized the spiritual sterility and the barriers 
            of the North as he strives to belong in the South where he feels his roots are. His 
            identity is fragmented and he struggles to articulate who he is. Kabnis attempts to look 
            to the future and ignore the past and this very lack of acceptance contributes to 
            his absence of belonging. His inability to reconcile with Father John, a figure 
            who represents the past, leaves him as spiritually and culturally empty as he was
            in the beginning. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, Toomer creates a text in which the boundaries of identity, culture, and 
            place are blurred. During the Great Migration (when this novel was written), many 
            African Americans uprooted their families from the South and moved to the North to 
            cities in search of a better life. Cane raises important questions about what it 
            means to be ‘from’ somewhere and how history plays an important role in creating 
            meaning for a place.
