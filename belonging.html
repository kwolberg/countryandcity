          <h4 class='belong-titlep'>How does belonging/ identity appear in <i>Belonging: A Culture of Place</i>?</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            In <i>Belonging: A Culture of Place</i>, bell hooks thinks critically about race, gender, and class.
            She focuses on issues of identity, belonging, and what it means to be “from” somewhere. hooks charts her 
            journey from country to city and back again and through the first chapter, <u>readers start to understand that 
            rural America that exists beyond stereotypes and caricatures. It is a place more diverse and complex than what 
            is portrayed. </u>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Throughout “Kentucky is My Fate”, hooks asserts the difference between stereotypes and authentic experiences. 
            Media portrayals that proliferate online, in films, television, and  books are significant in one’s perception of place. 
            The rural south is often seen as less accepting than its northern, urban counterparts. However, hooks uses first-hand 
            experiences to highlight how urban racism is just as destructive, if not more so, than that in the South. hooks felt more
            accepted at home in Kentucky; she grew up in a natural environment that praised self-reliance and engagement with the land. 
            For hooks, Kentucky is a place where she is tied to her community through personal memories, fondness for natural elements,
            and ancestral history. <u>In the end, she realizes the importance of roots and how the place you learn to understand yourself 
            may be the only place you may ever truly feel a sense of belonging. </u>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            hooks challenges general stereotypes about rural areas and also stresses the importance of looking at places 
            with a critical lens. Hooks discusses the ways in which white individuals have convinced themselves that Kentucky was,
            and is, different from the Deep South in terms of racism. Yet, history tends to be fallacious and a romanticized version 
            of what really happened.<u>History, more specifically inaccurately portrayed history, can play a large role in how individuals
            identify themselves.</u>  Hooks makes the claim that it is important to <u>think critically about history and use a revised, 
            renewed history as a medium to inform the present and future to create a space where everyone feels a sense of belonging.</u> 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In the end, hooks highlights what means to belong to a place and how that belonging contributes to one’s identity.
            “Kentucky is My Fate” also gives readers a view into the rural south - one that is home to a variety of ethnicities,
            cultures, rich histories, and prominent feelings of belonging and community. Rural America is more complicated than 
            the headlines make it out to be. <u>Altogether, hooks suggests that where you come from and the values that you are 
            instilled with play an important role in where you feel you belong. </u>

            “I pay tribute to the past as a resource that can serve as a foundation for us to revision and renew 
            our commitment to the present, to making a world where all people can live fully and well, 
            where everyone can belong” (5)

        <div class="txt analysis1-belong">

            hooks writes about the importance of a more accurately portrayed history. 
            Throughout <i>Belonging: A Culture of Place</i>, she argues that history can be a powerful tool to look back on if it is 
            recounted correctly. The current, historical representations of marginalized groups are inaccurate and harmful; 
            the erasure of their history can impact the ways in which they understand who they are and where they belong. 
            hooks highlights this when she references white supremacist thinking and the separation of black jockeys from 
            Kentucky horse culture. As hook explains, there needs to be a wider reckoning of American history in order to 
            make a space where everyone can belong.

            “Living away from my native place I became more consciously Kentuckian than I was when I lived at home. 
            This is what the experience of exile can do… utterly transform one’s perception of the world of home” (13)

        <div class="txt analysis2-belong">
          <p>
            hooks realized that she belonged in Kentucky after being exposed to other places. She originally moved away from Kentucky
            to find a sense of belonging elsewhere. Yet, through her experiences in cities, she realized that those environments 
            are romanticized to seem ‘bigger and better’ even when they may not be. hooks becomes conscious of her identity as a 
            Kentuckian and realizes that she belongs in Kentucky, a place that she has a physical connection to.

            “I would return to Kentucky and feel again a sense of belonging that I never felt elsewhere, 
            experiencing unbroken ties to the land, to homefolk, to our vernacular speech” (24).

        <div class="txt analysis3-belong">

            This quote emphasizes hooks’ feelings regarding belonging. She feels the most at home in Kentucky due to her 
            connection to the land,  people, and even the dialect. Despite its history and the negative connotations surrounding 
            the rural south, hooks feels as though she belongs in Kentucky -  it is a place that allows her to 
            be herself unashamedly. These feelings are unlike those she had elsewhere - in California, 
            she took measures to hide her southern accent. hooks returns to Kentucky and reclaims it as her home, 
            and is able to feel a sense of belonging by doing so.
