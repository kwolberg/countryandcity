    <div class="statement">
      <p class="purpose">The purpose of this website is to act as an accessible resource to students
        of ENVIRON 377/ ENGLISH 320: "Country and City". Students of this course can
        look back at this site to remember some of the analytical work we pursued when 
        looking at <i>Cane</i>, <i>There There</i>, and <i>Belonging: A Culture of Place</i>. I chose these texts becauase
        they all explore ideas about how one's environment plays a role in a feeling of 'belonging' and 
        affects ones identity.
      </p> 
      <br>
      <p class="purpose2">The questions I asked myself when creating this website are as follows: <br> <br>
        <li>What does it mean to ‘belong’ to a community?</li>
        <li>How does the Internet serve as a place where we can understand different identities? </li>
        <li>How do societal definitions affect our sense of identity?</li> <br>
