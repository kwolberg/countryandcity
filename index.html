    <div class="statement">
      <p class="purpose">The purpose of this website is to act as an accessible resource to students
        of ENVIRON 377/ ENGLISH 320: "Country and City". Students of this course can
        look back at this site to remember some of the analytical work we pursued when 
        looking at <i>Cane</i>, <i>So Far From God</i>, and <i>There There</i>. I chose these texts becauase
        they all explore ideas about how one's environment plays a role in a feeling of 'belonging' and 
        affects ones identity.
      </p> 
      <p class="purpose2">The questions I asked myself when creating this website are as follows:<br> 
        What does it mean to ‘belong’ to a community?<br>
        How do societal definitions affect our sense of identity? <br>
        How does the Internet serve as a place where we can understand identities other than our own?
