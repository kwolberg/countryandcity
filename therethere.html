          <h4 class="there-titlep">How does belonging/ identity appear in <i>There There?</i></h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            Tommy Orange’s <i>There There</i> tells the story of twelve characters from varying Native 
            communities living and interacting in Oakland, California. Each character 
            has a different story, but they are all connected - whether it be by chance, 
            their attendance at the Big Oakland Powwow, or their collective generational trauma. 
            <i>There There</i> is a story about how a violent history can inform the decisions, actions, and 
            identities of individuals in the present. Through the cacophony of voices and perspectives, 
            <u>Orange explores the complex nature of what it means to be Native American in the 21st century.</u>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The first character Orange introduces to the reader is Tony Loneman, a Native American 
            man affected by fetal alcohol syndrome. Tony’s decision to rob the Big Oakland Powwow 
            gives the book its central narrative. The robbery leads to a destructive and unsettling 
            ending that reflects the ways in which Native Americans internalize and reproduce the v
            iolence done unto them by past colonizers and present oppressors. Orange uses Tony, and 
            the events at the Powwow, to show the effects of generational trauma. Other characters as 
            well are affected by past traumas manifesting as alcoholism, drug use, and obesity. 
            <u>There There highlights how trauma transcends generations; many characters attempt to 
              understand this and escape the painful legacy that they’ve inherited. </u>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Generational trauma and grappling with a history of oppression also result in many 
            characters struggling with their identity. Societal expectations affect how Native Americans 
            view their identity and tend to proliferate untrue, generalized images in the media. 
            Some individuals, like Orvil, feel a desire to be more connected with their heritage. Others, 
            most visibly Jacquie and Opal, try to disconnect from their culture and the trauma it bears. 
            <u>Orange proposes the idea that Native identity, particularly in urban spaces, is extremely 
              complicated.</u> Everyone in the novel has different experiences and just because they do not 
            look, dress, or have a certain percentage of Native blood, does not mean that they aren’t 
            ‘Native” or that they don’t feel the effects of centuries of oppression. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The title of the novel comes from a Gertrude Stein quote in reference to the city of her 
            childhood, Oakland, California: “there is no there there” she wrote. This is in reference to 
            the gentrification of Oakland  - the place she once knew becoming unrecognizable. Dene Oxedene,
            a character who works to tell the stories of the Native Americans Oakland, connects this 
            quote to the history and erasure of Native people and culture. He draws a direct parallel 
            between the displacement and gentrification of cities like Oakland and the colonization of 
            Native Americans. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Orange highlights how <u> the Internet can be a place that helps to bring individuals into contact 
              with their origins.</u> Orvil uses YouTube to research his heritage; Edwin finds his biological 
            father on Facebook. The Internet builds a universal community and in an ideal world, everyone 
            is equal as the lack of a physical body takes away one's racial, gender, and class identity. 
            Nevertheless, the Internet can be a place of hate. Daniel Gonzales uses the Internet to create 
            a gun and technology has aided in the gentrification of Oakland. As depicted throughout the 
            novel, <u>the Internet is a space that emulates real life - it can help people feel a sense of 
              belonging, but also can proliferate untrue narratives and violence.</u>

          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="bottomp">
            Overall, <i>There There</i> highlights how societal definitions and past traumas affect 
            Native American’s identities. In writing this novel, Orange highlights the importance of 
            oral and written history to refute society’s views of what it means to be Native American. 
            Orange paves the way for a conversation about the dangers of revisionist history and brings 
            the <u>realities of modern Native Americans to the forefront.</u> Orange ultimately suggests that 
            <u>>until there is a wider reckoning of history and until more Native Americans are better 
              represented in media forms, Native American individuals will continue to struggle with 
              their cultural identity.</u>

            “We know the sound of the freeway better than we do rivers, the howl of

            There There depicts the lives of urban Native Americans, those who know 
            “the sound of the freeway” better than “rivers.” Society tends to associate Native 
            Americans with environmentalism, which Orange refutes. The modern-day Native American
             does not have to “connect” with the land in order to be Native American; the overarching 
             societal ideas influence the ways in which Native Americans view themselves and by 
             introducing a more accurate view of Native life, Orange is trying to change the discourse 
             surrounding Native American culture.

            ahead and the needle, the bottle, or the pipe is the only thing in sight that makes sense” (106).

            Native Americans lost their land and culture at the hands of colonialism, and those 
            losses still affect Native Americans today. Generational trauma has manifested itself 
            as addiction or substance abuse; characters in There There attempt to escape the pain 
            of their own lives and the lives of their parents and ancestors. Orange highlights 
            throughout the novel the effects of generational trauma and how the history of the past 
            influences characters in the present.

            “Her mom said spiders carry miles of web in their bodies, miles of story, 
            miles of potential home and trap. She said that’s what we are. Home and trap.” (163)

            Addiction, memory, and ignorance are just a few of the things the novel’s characters 
            encounter which threaten to ensnare them (and beckon to house them) much like a spider’s web. 
            The entire book acts like a spider's web of sorts: every character has a place or 'home' in 
            their culture, their stories are all connected in this web, but the trauma of centuries of 
            Native oppression traps them in some ways too, just like a spider's web.
